During the Afghan Civil War (1996–2001), resistance toward the Taliban largely concentrated in the north of Afghanistan, serving as the stronghold of the Northern Alliance. In response to speculations from the Afghanistan Analysts Network that the Taliban's concentration of its forces in the north might be an attempt to forestall the re-emergence of a counterpart to the Northern Alliance post-US troop withdrawal, new developments have taken place. Previously, the Taliban's takeover of Zaranj, the provincial capital of Nimruz Province, marked it as the group's first major capture of a provincial city since the 2001 invasion. 

Still, signs of resonating resistance have emerged. Russian intelligence sources now report that Panjshir resistance forces - those loyal to Amrullah Saleh - have successfully recaptured Charikar and its surrounding areas within Parwan Province from Taliban control. This signifies not only a strategic setback for the Taliban but also serves as a refreshing hint toward the potential resurgence of forces similar to the former Northern Alliance.<History>"
