## Overview
**Event Triggered Article Updating System** is a long article updating application for knowledge update.

Spearheaded the development of an Event Triggered Article Updating System, a cutting-edge application designed for updating long articles with new knowledge. This project showcases a significant advancement in handling full-text knowledge updating triggered by news events, leveraging the capabilities of large language models (LLMs).

The whole system is trained on [**NetKu dataset**](https://github.com/hhhuang/NetKu) for *knowledge updating in full-text triggered by a News Event*.

## Demo
A live demonstation of the model can be accessed at [Live Demo](http://140.119.164.212:7840) with GPU support, and [HF Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/theQuert/Event-Triggered-Article-Updating-System) with CPU support.

## Key Features
1. **Long texts input support**: Overcame the limitations of existing LLMs by enabling the system to understand and process long context inputs. Developed a unique approach allowing for unlimited full-article input lengths, with each paragraph handling up to 4,096 tokens.

2. **Instruction-Tuned Models**: Implemented multiple baseline models, including those fine-tuned on LLaMA, Alpaca, Vicuna, and GPT-based models, demonstrating versatility and adaptability in model training.

3. **Innovative Model Architecture**: Proposed and developed a new Encoder-Decoder based model architecture. Conducted comprehensive evaluations to prove the effectiveness of this novel approach in the context of knowledge updating.
