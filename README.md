## Overview
Event Triggered Article Updating System (NetKUp) is a long article updating application for knowledge update.

**NetKUp** trained on [NetKu dataset](https://github.com/hhhuang/NetKu) for knowledge updating task.

## Demo
A live demonstation of the model can be accessed at [Live Demo](http://140.119.164.212:7840) with GPU support, and [HF Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/theQuert/Event-Triggered-Article-Updating-System) with CPU support.

## Key Features
1. **Long texts input support**: Curently due to the limitation of LLMs, long context input is not clearly understood, and hard to capture relationshtip between pargraphs. We make it suitable for longer inputs.

2. **Instruction-Tuned**: We provide multiple baselines, including fine-tuned our data on **Alpaca**, **Vicuna**,  and GPT based models.

3. **Model Architecture**: We proposed the new construction of Encoder-Decoder based model. And further prove the effectiveness of our model.
