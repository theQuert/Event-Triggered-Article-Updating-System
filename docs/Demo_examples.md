The COVID-19 pandemic in Queensland is part of the ongoing worldwide pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). <Summary>\\c\\cOn 29 January 2020, Queensland was the first to declare a public health emergency. The legislation was strengthened on 6 February by the Public Health (Declared Public Health Emergencies) Amendment Bill 2020. As of the end of July 2021, Queensland had recorded the death of just 7 patients with Covid-19. This fatality rate, of just under 1 per million residents, was the lowest not just in Australia, but of any sizeable jurisdiction with its own policing and health powers, in the world. <Timeline - 2020>\\c\\cKey directions made under the Public Health Act 2005 include: <Timeline - 2020>\\c\\c2 April – A person must not leave their principal place of residence except for essential needs including work, food, medical and exercise, outdoor gatherings only up to 2 persons or with members of household, receiving only to 2 visitors at a residence, and no gatherings in non-residences. <Timeline - 2020>\\c\\c9 April – "Non-essential" business, activity or undertaking must not be operated. "Non-essential" businesses include cinemas, casinos, concerts, indoor sports, gyms, playgrounds, campgrounds, libraries. Restrictions also apply to restaurants (take away or delivery only), churches, hairdressers etc. However, most construction, mining, manufacturing and retail businesses continued to operate. <Timeline - 2020>\\c\\cRestricted entry into Queensland was introduced, with only Queensland residents and those considered an \'exempt person\' being allowed to enter Queensland by air, sea, rail or road from another state or territory. This was introduced in stages: Stage 1 started on 26 March 2020, with stages 2 and 3 involving tightening the restrictions. Stage 4, introduced on 11 April, was the most restrictive, every person crossing the border including Queensland residents required a permit. In addition, a person who had been in a declared COVID-19 hotspot in the previous 14 days had to self-quarantine for 14 days. <Timeline - 2020>\\c\\cClosure of high visitation National Parks including Fraser Island as well as all day use areas and visitor centres on 9 April. <Timeline - 2020>\\c\\cClosure of Queensland waters to cruise ships on 6 April. <Timeline - 2020>\\c\\cClosure of Surfers Paradise, Coolangatta and The Spit beaches on 8 April. <Timeline - 2020>\\c\\cAccess to the Torres Strait Islands has been restricted to prevent COVID-19 from reaching the region, which has to date remained free of cases. <Timeline - 2020>\\c\\cOn 1 February 2021, Queensland opened its border to all Australian states and territories except Western Australia. Since the border closures were implemented, 6,855,750 border passes were issued. <Timeline - 2021>\\c\\cOn 22 February, the first Queenslander received a COVID-19 vaccination at Gold Coast University Hospital. She was a nurse who works in that hospital's COVID-19 ward. <Timeline - 2021>\\c\\cOn 28 February 2021, the "Check in Qld" QR code sign-in/contact tracing app was launched by the Minister for Health and Ambulance Services, Yvette D\'Ath. It is based on the ACT "Check in CBR" app. Use of the app is not mandatory. <Timeline - 2021>\\c\\cOn 12 March, Princess Alexandra Hospital in Brisbane went into lockdown after a doctor tested positive for COVID-19. This was the beginning of one cluster in Brisbane connected to that hospital. Queensland had gone 59 days without any locally acquired COVID-19 infections. <Timeline - 2021>\\c\\cDue to a growing cluster in Bondi, Sydney, from 1am on 24 June, the Queensland government declared all of Greater Sydney was a hotspot. Border entry will be refused to anyone who lives in, or has visited: Greater Sydney, the Blue Mountains, Central Coast, Wollongong or Shellharbour. Residents returning will be quarantined for 14 days. Everyone entering Queensland will have to complete a border declaration. <Timeline - 2021>\\c\\cOn 8 January 2021, a three-day lockdown was announced by Annastacia Palaszczuk to prevent spread of the more contagious UK strain of coronavirus that escaped from a Brisbane hotel quarantine. The lockdown applied to all of greater Brisbane including council areas of Brisbane, Ipswich, Logan City, Moreton Bay and Redland City from 6 pm that day. More than 2 million residents were affected. <Timeline - Brisbane lockdowns>\\c\\cOn 29 March at 5 pm, Greater Brisbane went into yet another three-day lockdown. The step was taken when a second cluster of the UK strain of COVID-19 grew to seven people. Two of them were an un-vaccinated nurse from Princess Alexandra Hospital, and her sister. By 30 March another 8 locally acquired cases were reported, for a total of 10 new cases in the preceding 24 hours, and 2 separate clusters, both UK strain were identified. As of this date Queensland had 78 active cases in hospitals. On 31 March in Queensland 34,711 coronavirus tests and 7,596 vaccinations were conducted. <Timeline - Brisbane lockdowns>\\c\\cOn 1 April, the "three-day" lockdown was lifted five hours early at midday. Though 10 new cases had been recorded in the previous 24 hours, there was only one case of community transmission, which was linked to the second cluster surrounding the infected nurse from the Princess Alexandra Hospital. This cluster now numbered 12, up from 7 on 29 March. <Timeline - Brisbane lockdowns>\\c\\cSome restrictions introduced for the lockdown were maintained temporarily: <Timeline - Brisbane lockdowns>\\c\\call Queenslanders had to carry a face-mask outside their home until 15 April, <Timeline - Brisbane lockdowns>\\c\\cpatrons at food or beverage venues had to stay seated, no dancing allowed, <Timeline - Brisbane lockdowns>\\c\\c30 person limit at private gatherings at homes statewide, <Timeline - Brisbane lockdowns>\\c\\cbusinesses and churches could open, but have only one-person-per 2-square-metres of floor area, <Timeline - Brisbane lockdowns>\\c\\cvisitors were not permitted for 2 weeks at: aged or disabled care facilities, hospitals and prisons. <Timeline - Brisbane lockdowns>\\c\\cOn 28 June Queensland recorded 3 new COVID-19 cases overnight. 2 were locally acquired, one acquired overseas. A miner was found to be infected with the Delta variant of COVID-19 after returning from the Northern Territory. As a result of these cases, from 10pm on 29 June, masks became mandatory in these local government areas: <Timeline - Brisbane lockdowns>\\c\\cBrisbane <Timeline - Brisbane lockdowns>\\c\\cGold Coast <Timeline - Brisbane lockdowns>\\c\\cIpswich <Timeline - Brisbane lockdowns>\\c\\cLogan <Timeline - Brisbane lockdowns>\\c\\cLockyer Valley <Timeline - Brisbane lockdowns>\\c\\cMoreton Bay <Timeline - Brisbane lockdowns>\\c\\cNoosa <Timeline - Brisbane lockdowns>\\c\\cRedlands <Timeline - Brisbane lockdowns>\\c\\cScenic Rim Region <Timeline - Brisbane lockdowns>\\c\\cSomerset <Timeline - Brisbane lockdowns>\\c\\cSunshine Coast Region <Timeline - Brisbane lockdowns>\\c\\cIn addition: <Timeline - Brisbane lockdowns>\\c\\cMasks must be worn in workplaces when another person is present. <Timeline - Brisbane lockdowns>\\c\\cDancing is again banned <Timeline - Brisbane lockdowns>\\c\\cNo more than 30 people are allowed inside homes. <Timeline - Brisbane lockdowns>\\c\\cAfter the lockdown was expanded: <Timeline - Brisbane lockdowns>\\c\\cMasks mandatory when leaving the house. <Timeline - Brisbane lockdowns>\\c\\cHousehold visitors limited to 2 <Timeline - Brisbane lockdowns>\\c\\cFunerals restricted to 20 people <Timeline - Brisbane lockdowns>\\c\\cWeddings restricted to 10 people <Timeline - Brisbane lockdowns>\\c\\cdancing and singing not allowed <Timeline - Brisbane lockdowns>\\c\\cRestaurants and cafes can only provide: <Timeline - Brisbane lockdowns>\\c\\ctake away <Timeline - Brisbane lockdowns>\\c\\chome delivery. <Timeline - Brisbane lockdowns>\\c\\cOn 29 June from 6pm the lockdown was expanded to new areas. All of: <Timeline - Brisbane lockdowns>\\c\\cSouth East Queensland <Timeline - Brisbane lockdowns>\\c\\cTownsville city <Timeline - Brisbane lockdowns>\\c\\cMagnetic Island and <Timeline - Brisbane lockdowns>\\c\\cPalm Island <Timeline - Brisbane lockdowns>\\c\\cwent into lockdown for 3 days, till 6pm on 2 July. This move was taken after a casual clerical worker from Prince Charles Hospital in Brisbane, who worked outside the COVID ward as a concierge, became infected with the Delta variant and travelled from Sandgate in Brisbane to Magnetic Island and Townsville where she visited markets. From 6:00am on 23 July to 6:00am on 20 August the same rules will be used across the state, except for SE Queensland where masks were still required. <Timeline - Brisbane lockdowns>\\c\\cIn SE Queensland wearing a face mask is mandatory whenever outside the home, unless: <Timeline - Brisbane lockdowns>\\c\\cin a car alone <Timeline - Brisbane lockdowns>\\c\\cor with household members <Timeline - Brisbane lockdowns>\\c\\ceating or drinking <Timeline - Brisbane lockdowns>\\c\\cexercising <Timeline - Brisbane lockdowns>\\c\\coutdoors alone <Timeline - Brisbane lockdowns>\\c\\cor with household members <Timeline - Brisbane lockdowns>\\c\\cit is unsafe <Timeline - Brisbane lockdowns>\\c\\cOn 24 July 2021, there was an anti-lockdown protest in Brisbane. There were also protests in Melbourne, and in Sydney, where several people were arrested, infringement notices issued and over 50 people charged. <Timeline - Brisbane lockdowns>\\c\\cOn 31 July from 4pm, 11 LGAs in South East Queensland went into a snap lockdown for 3 days. This was after 6 new locally acquired cases of the Delta COVID variant. The areas affected were: <Timeline - Brisbane lockdowns>\\c\\cBrisbane, Gold Coast, Ipswich, Lockyer Valley, Logan, Moreton Bay, Noosa, Redlands, Sunshine Coast, Somerset and Scenic Rim. One of the cases is a medical student at the University of Queensland, who had been to many venues, including Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital, the University of Queensland, and the Translational Research Institute at Princess Alexandra Hospital. <Timeline - Brisbane lockdowns>\\c\\cBy 1 August there were 18 locally acquired cases of Delta variant. Deputy Premier Steven Miles said that the 9 new cases were the greatest number since August 2020. <Timeline - Brisbane lockdowns>\\c\\cOn 2 August there were 15 new cases of COVID-19, 2 overseas acquired. Consequently, the South-east Queensland’s lockdown was extended until 4:00pm on 8 August (Sunday). The same day, because of the extension, the Ekka agricultural show was cancelled for the second year, 5 days before it was to be open to the public from 7 August (Saturday). [ADD] <Timeline - Brisbane lockdowns>\\c\\cOn 8 August the lockdown in SE Queensland ended, though some restrictions remained in force, including mandatory wearing of masks.

The Sinai insurgency is an ongoing insurgency in the Sinai Peninsula, Egypt, that was commenced by Islamist militants against Egyptian security forces, which have also included attacks on civilians. The insurgency began during the Egyptian Crisis, during which the longtime Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak was overthrown in the Egyptian revolution of 2011. <Summary>\\c\\cThe Sinai insurgency initially consisted of militants, largely composed of local Bedouin tribesmen, who exploited the chaotic situation in Egypt and weakened central authority to launch a series of attacks on government forces in Sinai. In 2014, elements of the Ansar Bait al-Maqdis group pledged allegiance to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL or ISIS) and proclaimed themselves Sinai Province, and a part of ISIL. Security officials say militants based in Libya have established ties with the Sinai Province group and have blamed the porous border and ongoing civil war for the increase in sophisticated weapons available to the Islamist groups. <Summary>\\c\\cEgyptian authorities have attempted to restore their presence in the Sinai through both political and military measures. Egypt launched two military operations, known as Operation Eagle in mid-2011 and then Operation Sinai in mid-2012. In May 2013, following an abduction of Egyptian officers, violence in the Sinai surged once again. Following the 2013 Egyptian coup d\'état, which resulted in the ousting of Egyptian president Mohamed Morsi, "unprecedented clashes" have occurred. <Summary>\\c\\cThe fallout suffered by the locals as a result of the insurgency in Sinai ranges from militant operations and the state of insecurity to extensive military operations and the demolishing of hundreds of homes and evacuating thousands of residents as Egyptian troops pressed on to build a buffer zone meant to halt the smuggling of weapons and militants from and to the Gaza strip. A report, compiled by a delegation from the state-funded National Council for Human Rights (NCHR), stated that most of the displaced families share the same grievances of palpable government negligence, unavailability of nearby schools for their sons and the lack of health services. Since the start of the conflict, dozens of civilians were killed either in military operations or kidnapped and then beheaded by militants. In November 2017, more than 300 Sufist worshippers were killed and over 100 injured in a terrorist attack on a mosque west of the city of Al-Arish. <Summary>\\c\\cSufism was previously dominant in the region before militant jihadi ideas began to take hold. The Sinai Peninsula has long been known for its lawlessness, having historically served as a smuggling route for weapons and supplies. Security provisions in the Egypt–Israel peace treaty of 1979 have mandated a diminished security presence in the area, enabling militants to operate with a freer hand. Moreover, the limited government-directed investment and development in Sinai has discriminated against the local Bedouin population, a population that values tribal allegiance over all else. The combination of Sinai's harsh terrain and lack of resources have kept the area poor and hence ripe for militancy. <Background>\\c\\cFollowing the January 2011 uprising that toppled Hosni Mubarak's regime, the country became increasingly destabilized, creating a security vacuum in the Sinai Peninsula. Radical Islamic elements in Sinai exploited the opportunity, using the unique environment, in launching several waves of attacks upon Egyptian military and commercial facilities. <Background>\\c\\cAccording to The Economist, the conflict also involves local armed Bedouins "who have long-standing grievances against the central government in Cairo" and that "they are barred from joining the army or police; they find it hard to get jobs in tourism; and they complain that many of their lands have been taken from them". <Background>\\c\\cSince the 2011 uprising against the Mubarak regime in Egypt, there has been increasing instability in the Sinai Peninsula. In addition, the collapse of the Libyan regime increased the quantity and sophistication of weapons being smuggled into the area. The situation provided local Bedouin with an opportunity to assert their authority, leading to clashes with Egyptian security forces, but the cause of violence soon transitioned to salafi jihadism. Hard-line militant Muslims used Sinai as a launch-point for attacks against Israel and turned on the Egyptian state, focusing on Egypt's security establishment and the Sinai's Arab Gas Pipeline. <Timeline - 2011–2012>\\c\\cIn August 2011, Egypt launched Operation Eagle in an effort to restore law and order, driving Islamist insurgents and criminal gangs out of North Sinai's urban centers, and to attempt to sever the link between militant groups in the Sinai and Gaza by augmenting its control over the Gaza border crossing. <Timeline - Operation Eagle>\\c\\cThe operation had limited success, and a week into the operation, Salafi jihadists carried out the biggest cross-border attack on Israel in the post-Mubarak period. <Timeline - Operation Eagle>\\c\\cOn 5 August 2012, an attack on the Rafah barracks shook the Egyptian military and population. Only a month into his term, President Mohamed Morsi sacked the longstanding defence minister and promoted General al Sisi in his place. Operation Sinai was launched, aimed at eliminating armed Islamist groups, protecting the Suez Canal, and destroying the tunnel network connecting the Sinai with the Gaza Strip. During the operation, 32 militants and suspects were killed and 38 arrested, while 2 civilians were killed by early September 2012. <Timeline - Operation Sinai>\\c\\cSince the July 2013 coup against President Mohamed Morsi, a Muslim Brotherhood leader, Egyptian military and security services in particular were targeted by Sinai-based Islamist groups. In an increase in violence, security forces came under near daily attack throughout July to August 2013. <Timeline - 2013–2014>\\c\\cIn 2013, the new authorities adopted a more aggressive strategy, leading to mass arrests and harsh security measures. <Timeline - 2013–2014>\\c\\cOver the few months leading to 2014, the Egyptian army gained the upper hand in the battle against militias that had found safe haven in the peninsula. After isolating and largely clearing the populated northeastern Sinai, the army put many militant factions on the defensive, most notably Ansar Bait al-Maqdis. However, one thousand armed militiamen were still sheltering in the main stronghold in Jabal Halal, as well as Jabal Amer area. <Timeline - 2013–2014>\\c\\cIn November 2014, the situation in the Sinai was thrust into the spotlight with the deadliest attack on the security forces since 2011, and the group responsible Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis pledging allegiance to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) forming the Sinai Province. <Timeline - May>\\c\\cIn the wake of the attack on the security forces, the government declared state of emergency, imposing a curfew and establish a buffer zone in the Sinai's border area with Gaza. <Timeline - May 2013 hostage crisis>\\c\\cIn May 2013, a number of Egyptian Army police officers were taken hostage by armed tribesmen in the Sinai Peninsula, with videos released on the internet with them begging for their lives. As a response, Egypt's government built up security forces in northern Sinai as part of an effort to secure the release of six policemen and a border guard kidnapped by suspected militants. On 20–21 May, Egyptian troops and police, backed by helicopter gunships, conducted a sweep through a number of villages in northern Sinai, along the border with Israel. The officials said the forces came under fire from gunmen in vehicles, triggering the clashes. The clashes left one gunman dead by 21 May. The hostages were released on 22 May after talks between the captors and Bedouins. One suspect in the kidnapping was arrested on 30 May 2013. <Timeline - July>\\c\\cAfter Morsi's ouster on 3 July by Sisi, there was an increase in violence by armed Bedouin and Islamists. Attacks on security forces took place almost daily — leading many to link the militants there to the Muslim Brotherhood, the Islamist group from which Morsi hails. <Timeline - July 2013 escalation following Morsi ousting>\\c\\cIn response, Egypt launched a major military operation in Sinai against the militants, bringing in two additional battalions. <Timeline - July 2013 escalation following Morsi ousting>\\c\\cIn the two weeks following 3 July, 39 terrorist attacks occurred in North Sinai. In the resulting clashes between armed groups and security forces, 52 gunmen and civilians and six security personnel died. On 15 July, a bus transporting workers to the army-operated Al-Arish Cement Company was attacked leaving five killed and 15 wounded, the highest civilian casualties. On 16 July, attacks resulted in some of the most intense army engagement, concentrated at Al-Masa\'id, Al-Joura, and the Central Security camp at Al-Ahrash. <Timeline - July 2013 escalation following Morsi ousting>\\c\\cSecurity operations have been largely confined to the 40-kilometre area between Al-Arish and Sheikh Zuweid, extending northward toward Rafah along the border with Israel and up to the Karen Abu Salem crossing. Fighting intensified between the gunmen and the joint army-police forces at night. The frequency of attacks varied from two to five in a single day. In addition, targets expanded from fixed security checkpoints to mobile patrols. In most operations, the gunmen used four-wheel drive vehicles and combinations of light and heavy weaponry. However, in three attacks RPG-7 launchers were used, most likely smuggled from Libya. These grenades are capable of penetrating armoured vehicles and are generally fired at the doors. <Timeline - July 2013 escalation following Morsi ousting>\\c\\cOn 27 July, an operation dubbed "Desert Storm" was launched by the Egyptian army in North Sinai Governorate to last for 48 hours. Two of Egypt's field armies, as well as the country's air force and navy reportedly took part in the large-scale operation. <Timeline - July 2013 escalation following Morsi ousting>\\c\\cA bomb was placed at a hotel frequented by security officials on 2 August 2013, though it caused no injuries. A security source told the Egyptian newspaper Al-Masry Al-Youm that a majority of "terrorists" had been arrested as of 3 August 2013. 2 mausoleums were bombed on 4 August 2013, though no injuries resulted. <Timeline - July 2013 escalation following Morsi ousting>\\c\\cTwenty-five Egyptian policemen died in an attack in the northern region of Sinai, on 18 August. After militants forced two mini-buses carrying off-duty policemen to stop, ordered the policemen out and forced them to lie on the ground before shooting them. The Egyptian military arrested eleven people, including five Hamas members, three local residents and three foreign nationals, for their alleged involvement in the killings. The person who committed the murders confessed on 1 September 2013. <Timeline - July 2013 escalation following Morsi ousting>\\c\\cMilitary spokesperson Ahmed Ali said that Egyptian security forces operations in Sinai, from 5 July to 23 August, resulted in 78 suspected militants killed, including 32 foreigners; 116 people injured; and 203 people arrested, including 48 foreigners, for their alleged involvement in attacks on security checkpoints in the peninsula. Additionally 343 tunnels on the border with Gaza at Rafah were destroyed. <Timeline - July 2013 escalation following Morsi ousting>\\c\\cOn 3 September, fifteen Islamist militants were killed in an attack by military helicopters. <Timeline - September>\\c\\cOn 7 September, the Egyptian army launched a new operation in the region involving tanks and at least six Apache helicopters. The army jammed communications to thwart militant coordination. The army combed through areas near the Gaza Strip, including locations used by militants suspected in the killing and abduction of Egyptian soldiers over the past year. In the three days of operations, after 7 September, one officer, two soldiers and 29 militants were killed, and 39 militants arrested. <Timeline - December>\\c\\cOn 11 September, a suicide bomber targeted Egyptian military intelligence headquarters in Rafah, bringing down the structure, at the same time a car bomb had rammed an army checkpoint. In the simultaneous attack at least nine soldiers were killed. <Timeline - January>\\c\\cOn 24 December, 16 were killed and over 134 injured in a huge bomb which hit the Daqahliya Security Directorate in Mansoura, in the worst attack on a government site since the ouster of Morsi in July. Ansar Bait al-Maqdis, a Sinai-based group, claimed responsibility for the attack. The group deemed Egyptian troops infidels because they answer to a "secular government", warning them to desert or face death. <Timeline - 2014 helicopter downing>\\c\\cOn 26 January, militants shot down an army Mi-17 helicopter in North Sinai, killing all five of its crew members. The weapon the insurgents used was an infrared-homing, surface-to-air missile from the Russian-made Igla family. This was the first time in Egyptian history that an armed nonstate actor dropped a state's military helicopter by a missile. Ansar Bait al-Maqdis claimed responsibility for this attack as well as series of escalating attacks on police and soldiers. Earlier that morning masked men in an SUV attacked a bus carrying soldiers in Sinai, killing at least three and injuring at least 11. <Timeline - February>\\c\\cOn 3 February, in what was described as the biggest operation in the Egyptian army's ongoing offensive against militants in the Sinai, 30 suspected militants were killed and another 15 injured in a series of airstrikes and another 16 were arrested. <Timeline - 2014 Taba bus bombing>\\c\\cOn 16 February 2014, a bomb exploded on or under a tour bus of a South Korean church group in the Egyptian city of Taba, which borders the Gulf of Aqaba and Eilat, Israel. The bombing killed 4 people – 3 South Koreans and the Egyptian bus driver – and injured 17 others. According to The New York Times, the bombing could "offer worrying new evidence that militants who have been attacking Egypt's security forces for months were broadening their campaign against civilians." <Timeline - October>\\c\\cOn 24 October 2014, 33 army and police soldiers were killed in two separate attacks in North Sinai. The attack was the largest ever since the start of the war on terror in Sinai. As a result of the attack, president Abdel Fattah el-Sisi declared a state of emergency in the governorate after meeting with the National Defence Council for several hours. The state of emergency was to last for three months and to include a daily curfew from 5 pm to 7 am until further notice. <Timeline - October 2014 Sinai attacks>\\c\\cOn 10 November 2014, Ansar Bait al-Maqdis pledged allegiance to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) forming the Sinai Province group with a confusingly similar name to two Egyptian regional governments. <Timeline - 2015>\\c\\cOn 14 November 2014, ISIL published a video online that included footage of the group carrying out the October 2014 Sinai attacks. <Timeline - January 2015 Sinai attacks>\\c\\cDuring 2015, the intensity and the scale of insurgent attacks expanded. <Timeline - Security response>\\c\\cOn 12 January 2015, Sinai Province kidnapped a police officer while traveling in North Sinai and took him to an unknown location. On the following day on 13 January 2015, Egyptian military spokesperson announced the discovery of the dead body of the officer after launching a search operation. He also said that during the operation 10 militants were killed, while two others were arrested. <Timeline - March>\\c\\cOn 26 January 2015, Sinai Province published a video online that included the kidnapping and execution of the police officer kidnapped on 12 January. <Timeline - June>\\c\\cOn 29 January 2015, militants from the Sinai Province militant group launched a series of attacks on army and police bases in Arish using car bombs and mortars. The attacks, which occurred in more than six different locations, resulted in 44 confirmed deaths including army personnel and civilians. <Timeline - July 2015 Sinai attacks>\\c\\cIt was reported that on 6 February 2015 Egyptian security forces attacked the Sinai Province group, killing 47 Islamic militants in Northern Sinai. <Timeline - July 2015 Sinai attacks>\\c\\cOn 10 March 2015, a suicide attack on a police barracks using a water tanker was stopped after security forces opened fire on the water tanker causing it to explode before it could get into the barracks. One civilian near the scene was killed and two other civilians alongside 30 policemen were wounded in the blast. <Timeline - July 2015 Sinai attacks>\\c\\cOn 2 April 2015, an attack on an army checkpoint resulted in the death of 15 soldiers, 2 civilians and 15 attackers. As a response to the attack, the Egyptian army launched an operation the following day allegedly killing 100 militants. <Timeline - July 2015 Sinai attacks>\\c\\cOn 8 April 2015, eleven civilians were killed in Sheikh Zuweid when an unidentified rocket-propelled grenade hit their homes. A roadside bomb killed two officers in the same city. <Timeline - July 2015 Sinai attacks>\\c\\cOn 12 April 2015, 6 soldiers were killed when their armoured vehicle was bombed in North Sinai. On the same day, a separate attack on a police station in Arish resulted in the death of 5 policemen and 1 civilian. 40 were also injured, both policemen and civilians. The attack on the station was carried out by a suicide-bomber using a bomb-laden van, on which the police forces opened fire, causing a large explosion which reportedly created a large crater and shattered house windows near the police station. Militant group Ansar Beit Al-Maqdis has claimed responsibility for the attacks. <Timeline - July 2015 Sinai attacks>\\c\\cOn 27 April 2015, members from Al-Tarabin tribe in North Sinai launched an attack on Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis positions in Rafah. The attack came after Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis gunmen fatally shot a member of Al-Tarabin tribe in Berth village in southern Rafah, North Sinai, after he refused to take their warning statements ordering them not to deal with the Egyptian military. <Timeline - July 2015 Sinai attacks>\\c\\cOn 16 May 2015, three Egyptian judges and their driver were killed, and a fourth judge was severely wounded when gunmen opened fire on their vehicle in North Sinai. The attack came hours after a Cairo court issued a preliminary death sentence against former president Mohamed Morsi and 105 other defendants on a range of charges, including murder. <Timeline - August>\\c\\cOn 9 June 2015, militants fired rockets at the direction of an airport in Sinai used by the multinational peacekeeping forces. There were no casualties reported. ISIL affiliate Sinai Province claimed responsibility for the attack on several Twitter accounts linked to it. <Timeline - Operation Martyr's Right>\\c\\cOn 1 July 2015, ISIL Sinai Province militants launched one of the largest-scale battles seen in the Sinai Peninsula since the 1973 Yom Kippur War, and the largest attack since the insurgency begun in 2011, on multiple Egyptian army checkpoints in the Sinai Peninsula, killing 21 soldiers and wounding 9. However, unknown Egyptian security and medical officials reported that up to 64 soldiers had been killed in the attacks. The attack also targeted Sheikh Zuweid police station. Reinforcements from the Second Army Zone stationed in Ismailia have been deployed to Sheikh Zuweid, including Apache helicopters and F-16 fighter jets. Militants have reportedly killed several civilians who refused to allow them onto their rooftops to target security forces. An army statement claimed the killing of more than 100 militants from the attacking force. The militant death toll increased in the following days, due to Egyptian military operations in the region, reaching 241 killed. <Timeline - Operation Martyr's Right>\\c\\cOn 4 July 2015, a shell bomb struck a house in Sheikh Zuweid, killing a woman and her two children, the shell also seriously wounded another woman and a teenage girl. On the same day, a roadside bomb targeting army and police vehicles killed a five-year-old child in Rafah town that borders the Palestinian Gaza Strip.

The Taliban insurgency began after the group's fall from power during the 2001 War in Afghanistan. The Taliban forces are fighting against the Afghan government, formerly led by President Hamid Karzai, now led by President Ashraf Ghani, and against the US-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF). The insurgency has spread to some degree over the Afghanistan-Pakistan border to neighboring Pakistan, in particular Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The Taliban conduct warfare against Afghan National Security Forces and their NATO allies, as well as against civilian targets. Regional countries, particularly Pakistan, Iran, China and Russia, are often accused of funding and supporting the insurgent groups. <Summary>\\c\\cThe leader of the Taliban is Hibatullah Akhundzada, who heads the Quetta Shura. The allied Haqqani Network, Hezb-e Islami Gulbuddin, and smaller al-Qaeda groups have also been part of the insurgency. <Summary>\\c\\cFollowing the United States invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, the Taliban was defeated and many Taliban fighters left the movement or retreated to sanctuaries in Pakistan. In May and June 2003, high Taliban officials proclaimed the Taliban regrouped and ready for guerrilla war to expel US forces from Afghanistan. Omar assigned five operational zones to Taliban commanders such as Dadullah. Dadullah took charge in Zabul province. <Background>\\c\\cIn late 2004, the then hidden Taliban leader Mohammed Omar announced an insurgency against "America and its puppets" (i.e. transitional Afghan government forces) to "regain the sovereignty of our country". <Background>\\c\\cWhile The Taliban spent several years regrouping, they launched a re-escalation of the insurgency campaign in 2006. <Background>\\c\\cAs of 2017, the Taliban was composed of four different shuras, or representative councils. The first is the Quetta Shura. Two smaller shuras are subordinated to it, the Haqqani network (also known as the Miran Shah Shura) and the Peshawar Shura. The Pehsawar Shura was established in March 2005, and is based in eastern Afghanistan. The majority of its fighters are former members of the Hezb-e Islami Gulbuddin. The Haqqani network declared its autonomy from the Quetta Shura in 2007, and rejoined in August 2015. The Peshawar Shura was autonomous from 2009 until 2016. <Organization>\\c\\cThe second autonomous shura is the Shura of the North, based in Badakhshan Province. The third is the Mashhad Shura, sponsored by Iran, and the fourth is the Rasool Shura, led by Muhammad Rasul and also known as the High Council of the Islamic Emirate. <Organization>\\c\\cFollowing the Battle of Tora Bora and Operation Anaconda, The Taliban were defeated and many Taliban fighters left the movement or retreated to sanctuaries in Pakistan, where they began the initial stages of re-grouping. <2001–2006 Taliban insurgency re-grouping period>\\c\\cPamphlets by Taliban and other groups turned up strewn in towns and the countryside in early 2003, urging Islamic faithful to rise up against U.S. forces and other foreign soldiers in holy war. On 27 January 2003, during Operation Mongoose (War in Afghanistan), a band of fighters were assaulted by U.S. forces at the Adi Ghar cave complex 25 km (15 mi) north of Spin Boldak. Eighteen rebels were reported killed with no U.S. casualties. The site was suspected to be a base for supplies and fighters coming from Pakistan. The first isolated attacks by relatively large Taliban bands on Afghan targets also appeared around that time. <2001–2006 Taliban insurgency re-grouping period>\\c\\cIn May 2003 , the Taliban Supreme Court's chief justice, Abdul Salam, proclaimed that the Taliban were back, regrouped, rearmed, and ready for guerrilla war to expel U.S. forces from Afghanistan. Omar assigned five operational zones to Taliban commanders such as Dadullah, who took charge in Zabul province. <2001–2006 Taliban insurgency re-grouping period>\\c\\cSmall mobile Taliban training camps were established along the border to train recruits in guerrilla warfare, according to senior Taliban warrior Mullah Malang in June 2003. Most were drawn from tribal area madrassas in Pakistan. Bases, a few with as many as 200 fighters, emerged in the tribal areas by the summer of 2003. Pakistani will to prevent infiltration was uncertain, while Pakistani military operations proved of little use. <2001–2006 Taliban insurgency re-grouping period>\\c\\cAs the summer of 2003 continued, Taliban attacks gradually increased in frequency. Dozens of Afghan government soldiers, NGO humanitarian workers, and several U.S. soldiers died in the raids, ambushes and rocket attacks. Besides guerrilla attacks, Taliban fighters began building up forces in the district of Dai Chopan in Zabul Province. The Taliban decided to make a stand there. Over the course of the summer, up to 1,000 guerrillas moved there. Over 220 people, including several dozen Afghan police, were killed in August 2003. <2001–2006 Taliban insurgency re-grouping period>\\c\\cOperation Valiant Strike was a major United States military ground operation in Afghanistan announced on 19 March 2003 that involved 2nd and 3rd battalions of 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment, Romanian and Afghan troops. The combined forces moved through Kandahar and parts of Southern Afghanistan with the objective of eliminating Taliban enemy forces and weapons caches while also attempting to gather intelligence on Taliban activity in the area. At the conclusion of the operation on 24 March 2003, coalition forces had detained 13 suspected Taliban fighters and confiscated more than 170 rocket-propelled grenades, 180 land mines, 20 automatic rifles and machine guns, as well as many rockets, rifles, and launchers. <2001–2006 Taliban insurgency re-grouping period>\\c\\cUnited States led-coalition forces carried out Operation Asbury Park on June 2, 2004, and June 17, 2004, of taskforce 1/6 BLT of the 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit engaged in fighting with Taliban and other anti-coalition forces in both Oruzgan Province and Zabul Province culminating in the Dai Chopan region of Afghanistan. This operation was characterized by atypical fighting on the side of the tactics of the Taliban and the other guerillas encountered. culminating in a large battle on June 8. During Asbury Park, the 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit was faced with an opponent that frequently would dig in and engage the Marine forces, rather than the traditional hit and run (or "asymmetric attack") methods. As such, Marines, with the aid of B-1B Lancer, A-10 Warthog, and AH-64 Apache aircraft, engaged in "pitched battles each day," culminating in a large battle on June 8. The last of the fighting which took place near Dai Chopan on June 8 was decisive in that enemy forces were depleted to such an extent that no further contact was made with the enemy for the duration of the operation. What was meant by the enemy to be a three pronged attack June 8, 2004 resulted in over eighty-five confirmed kills, with estimates well in excess of 100 enemy dead, an estimated 200–300 wounded, with dozens captured. While throughout the entire operation a "handful" of US forces and Afghan Militia were injured. <2001–2006 Taliban insurgency re-grouping period>\\c\\cIn late 2004, the then hidden Taliban leader Mohammed Omar announced an insurgency against "America and its puppets" (i.e. transitional Afghan government forces) to "regain the sovereignty of our country". <2001–2006 Taliban insurgency re-grouping period>\\c\\cIn late June through mid-July 2005, United States Navy Seals carried out Operation Red Wings as a combined / joint military operation in the Pech District of Afghanistan's Kunar Province, on the slopes of a mountain named Sawtalo Sar, approximately 20 miles (32 km) west of Kunar's provincial capital of Asadabad, . Operation Red Wings was intended to disrupt local Taliban anti-coalition militia (ACM) activity, thus contributing to regional stability and thereby facilitating the Afghan Parliament elections scheduled for September 2005. At the time, Taliban anti-coalition militia activity in the region was carried out most notably by a small group, led by a local man from Nangarhar Province, Ahmad Shah, who had aspirations of regional Islamic fundamentalist prominence. He and his small group were among the primary targets of the operation. <2001–2006 Taliban insurgency re-grouping period>\\c\\cIn between August 13 and August 18 2005, United States Marine Corps carried out a military operation, called Operation Whalers that took place in Afghanistan's Kunar Province, just weeks after the disastrous Operation Red Wings. Like Operation Red Wings, the objective of Operation Whalers was the disruption of Taliban Anti-Coalition Militia (ACM) activity in the region in support of further stabilizing the region for unencumbered voter turnout for the September 18, 2005 Afghan National Parliamentary Elections. Operation Whalers was planned and executed by the 2nd Battalion of the 3rd Marine Regiment (2/3). The emphasis of the operation was an Anti-Coalition Militia cell led by Ahmad Shah, which was one of 22 identified ACM groups operating in the region at that time, and was the most active. Ahmad Shah's cell was responsible for the Navy SEAL ambush and subsequent MH-47 shootdown that killed, in total, 19 U.S. special operations personnel during Operation Red Wings. Operation Whalers, named after the Hartford / New England Whalers professional hockey team, was the "sequel" to Operation Red Wings in that it was aimed at furthering stabilization of the security situation in the restive Kunar Province of Eastern Afghanistan, a long-term goal of American and coalition forces operating in the area at that time. Operation Whalers, conducted by a number of Marine infantry companies of 2/3 with attached Afghan National Army soldiers and supported by conventional Army aviation, intelligence, and combat arms forces units and U.S. Air Force aviation assets, proved a success. Taliban Anti-Coalition Militia activity dropped substantially and subsequent human intelligence and signals intelligence revealed that Ahmad Shah had been seriously wounded. Shah, who sought to disrupt the September 18, 2005 Afghan National Parliamentary Elections, was not able to undertake any significant Taliban Anti-Coalition operations subsequent to Operation Whalers in Kunar or neighboring provinces. <2001–2006 Taliban insurgency re-grouping period>\\c\\cIn 2006, Afghanistan began facing a wave of attacks by improvised explosives and suicide bombers, particularly after NATO took command of the fight against insurgents in spring 2006. <2001–2006 Taliban insurgency re-grouping period>\\c\\cAfghan President Hamid Karzai publicly condemned the methods used by the western powers. In June 2006 he said: <2001–2006 Taliban insurgency re-grouping period>\\c\\cInsurgents were also criticized for their conduct. According to Human Rights Watch, bombing and other attacks on Afghan civilians by the Taliban (and to a lesser extent Hezb-e-Islami Gulbuddin), are reported to have "sharply escalated in 2006" with "at least 669 Afghan civilians were killed in at least 350 armed attacks, most of which appear to have been intentionally launched at civilians or civilian objects." 131 of insurgent attacks were suicide attacks which killed 212 civilians (732 wounded), 46 Afghan army and police members (101 wounded), and 12 foreign soldiers (63 wounded). <2001–2006 Taliban insurgency re-grouping period>\\c\\cThe United Nations estimated that for the first half of 2011, the civilian deaths rose by 15% and reached 1462, which is the worst death toll since the beginning of the war and despite the surge of foreign troops. <2001–2006 Taliban insurgency re-grouping period>\\c\\cJune: <2001–2006 Taliban insurgency re-grouping period>\\c\\c6 June: A roadside bombing leaves 2 American soldiers killed, the attack took place in the province of Nangarhar. Also a separate suicide bombing in Khost leaves three US soldiers wounded. <2001–2006 Taliban insurgency re-grouping period>\\c\\c15 June: A bus carrying workers to an American base explodes killing 10 and wounding 15.

Of that number, "only 2,000 to 3,000 are highly motivated, full-time insurgents", the Times reported. The rest are part-timers, made up of alienated, young Afghan men angry at bombing raids or fighting in order to get money. In 2007, more foreign fighters were showing up in Afghanistan than ever before, according to Afghan and United States officials. An estimated 100 to 300 full-time combatants are foreigners, usually from Pakistan, Uzbekistan, Chechnya, various Arab countries and perhaps even Turkey and western China.

In the meantime the Taliban insurgency spread to the northern provinces of the country. The new policy of the Taliban was to shift militants from the south to the north, to show they exist "everywhere", according to Faryab Province Governor Abdul Haq Shafaq. With most Afghan and NATO troops stationed in the southern and eastern provinces, villagers in the once-peaceful north found themselves confronted with a rapid deterioration of security, as insurgents seized new territory in provinces such as Kunduz and Baghlan, and even infiltrated the mountains of Badakhshan Province in the northeast. <2007 - Timeline>\\c\\cJanuary: <2007 - Timeline>\\c\\c17 January: "Kabul's day of terror": <2007 - Timeline>\\c\\cOn this day, gunbattles near the presidential palace and other government buildings paralyzed the Afghan capital for hours. <2007 - Timeline>\\c\\cAs President Karzai was swearing in his new cabinet ministers inside the presidential palace, militants performed attacks on multiple locations in Kabul, including shopping malls, a cinema and the central bank.

A government official said that the victims were beheaded for celebrating with music and mixgender dancing in the Musa Qala district of Helmand, which ran contrary to the Taliban's extreme brand of Islam. Later, however, a provincial government official said that the 17 people killed were due to a fight between two Taliban commanders over two women (who were also killed). The civilians were either beheaded or had their throats cut, but some showed signs of gunshot wounds or beatings. <2009 - Timeline>\\c\\cThe attacks were condemned by Afghanistan President Hamid Karzai, who ordered an investigation into the attack, the leader of the NATO coalition led by the United States, the United Nations, and the European Union. However, the Taliban has denied responsibility for the attack, saying that no Taliban members have ever killed civilians. <2009 - Timeline>\\c\\cThe attack occurred on the same day when two United States troops were killed by an Afghan soldier. <2009 - Timeline>\\c\\c10 Afghan soldiers were killed by the Taliban, also in the Helmand province. <2009 - Timeline>\\c\\cOn 3 April, Taliban gunmen and bombers attacked Farah, killing 34 civilians and 10 members of the security forces.

The Taliban has increased suicide attacks and has made multiple territorial gains across the country. <2009 - Timeline>\\c\\cBeginning in April, the Taliban fought for the city of Kunduz in the northern Kunduz Province with them capturing the city by September. Afghan Armed Forces recaptured the city in October but local sources dispute this claim. The quick fall of the city resulted in calls by some government officials for President Ashraf Ghani and CEO Abdullah Abdullah to resign. <2010>\\c\\cIn December, the Taliban made more territorial gains by besieging Afghan forces in the cities of Lashkar Gah, Sangin and outlying towns in the Helmand Province in Southern Afghanistan. By late December, most of Sangin was captured by the Taliban with local Afghan forces surrounded and forced to rely on airlifts for ammunition and food. <2010 - Timeline>\\c\\cThe gains made by the Taliban have hampered peace talks between them and the government and made rifts appear in the Taliban over negotiations. In response to the new offensives, it was reported that the United States would slow down their withdrawal of troops to help in counter-insurgency operations. <2010 - Timeline>\\c\\c14 April: Taliban attacking Kunduz; <2010 - Timeline>\\c\\c31 May: kidnapping a bus with 220 people, killing 10; <2010 - Timeline>\\c\\c1 June storming a court in Ghazni, 5 dead Taliban and 5 dead others; <2010 - Timeline>\\c\\cJune: Taliban have 25,000 fighters in Helmand, Kandahar and Uruzgan, according to US sources; <2010 - Timeline>\\c\\c18 July attacking Qalai Zal, unsuccessfully; <2010 - Timeline>\\c\\cJuly: 20% of Afghanistan is in Taliban hands, said Time magazine; <2010 - Timeline>\\c\\cDecember: Taliban controls 10% of Afghanistan, said the US military. <2010 - Timeline>\\c\\cOn 27 January, a Taliban suicide bomber killed over 100 people in Kabul using a bomb in an ambulance. <2010 - Timeline>\\c\\cThroughout most of the year, the US government maintained high-level talks with the Taliban, in an effort to secure a peace deal with the insurgency. However, a suicide bombing in Kabul on 7 September 2019 which killed 11 people and one American soldier prompted the US President to break-off peace talks with the Taliban. In mid September, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo alleged that the Taliban had suffered more than 1,000 war casualties in the space of only one week since the US broke off peace negotiations with the Taliban. <2010 - Timeline>\\c\\cOn 29 February, the United-States reached an agreement with representatives of the Taliban, in Doha, Qatar. The agreement calls for the withdrawal of all 13,000 U.S. and allied troops over the next 14 months, on the condition that the Taliban continues with the peace process. The first withdrawal, of around 5,000 personnel, will occur within the next 135 days. <2010 - Timeline>\\c\\cThe peace deal stipulates that the Taliban not allow terrorist organizations like al-Qaeda “to use the soil of Afghanistan to threaten the security of the United States and its allies.” If successful, the peace deal will bring an end to 18-years of conflict. Only days after signing the historic deal, US forces conducted airstrikes on Taliban soldiers as a "defensive" measure, as Taliban fighters were "actively attacking" an Afghan government checkpoint. <2010 - Timeline>\\c\\cOn 2 May, the US revealed that the agreement included an informal commitment for both sides to cut violence by 80%. Since the agreement was signed, attacks on cities and coalition forces had decreased, but overall attacks had increased 70% compared with the same period in 2019, according to Reuters. The Taliban claim that attacks have fallen since the agreement was signed. <2010 - Timeline>\\c\\cOn 14 May, a Taliban suicide truck bomber killed five civilians in Gardez, Paktia Province. On 18 May, the Taliban killed nine people in a similar attack in Ghazni Province.[citation needed] <2010 - Timeline>\\c\\cOn 29 May, it was revealed that numerous Taliban and Taliban-aligned Haqqani Network leaders were infected with COVID-19. This resulted in the late founder Mullah Mohammad Omar's son Mullah Mohammad Yaqoob being made the entire organization's acting leader. <2011>\\c\\cIn 2021, the United States forces and allies started to withdraw from Afghanistan which allowed the Taliban to intensify their insurgency. The Taliban controls more than 85% of Afghanistan. <2011 - Timeline>\\c\\cOn 29 June, intense fighting between Taliban insurgents and government forces killed 28 civilians and injured another 290 during the past week, according to the head of a hospital in Kunduz, with the majority of the dead being children, women and elderly people. The Taliban had moved beyond its southern strongholds and had intensified the fighting in the north, according to military experts. <2011 - Timeline>\\c\\cOn 2 July, U.S. troops fully left Bagram Airfield, handing it to the Afghan Armed Forces as the coalition, including the U.S., prepared to leave Afghanistan after 20 years. Meanwhile, fighting continued between the Taliban and government forces, with analysts said that the Taliban would be "at the door of Kabul". Afterwards, Bagram Airfield was looted by locals following the sudden American withdrawal from the airbase, which was conducted without any coordination with local officials. Afghan troops later cleared the airbase of looters and secured control of it. <2011 - Timeline>\\c\\cHowever, it was reported that, during June, the Taliban captured 700 Humvees as well as dozens of armored vehicles and artillery systems from the Afghan National Army as more districts fall under the group's control during their offensive in the north. <2011 - Timeline>\\c\\cOn 4 July, the Taliban took control of several further districts overnight as Afghan troops abandoned their posts and fled into neighboring Tajikistan via Badakhshan Province. The State Committee for National Security of Tajikistan reported that more than 300 Afghan troops crossed the Tajik border as Taliban spokesperson Zabiullah Mujahid confirmed that most of the territory gaining occurred without a fight. <2011 - Timeline>\\c\\cOn 5 July, Afghan presidential advisor Hamdullah Mohib said that there would be a counter-offensive against the Taliban in the north after the group captured six districts in Badakhshan Province. A day earlier, at least 1,037 Afghan troops abandoned their positions and fled into Tajikistan. <2011 - Timeline>\\c\\cOn 7 July, Taliban insurgents entered Qala e Naw, the provincial capital of Badghis Province, with heavy fighting reported as the militants moved "towards the centre of the city". All government officials in the city had been moved to a nearby army base, while the Taliban had freed about 400 prisoners from the city's prison. <2011 - Timeline>\\c\\cOn 9 July, the Taliban captured the border town of Islam Qala, Herat, Afghanistan's biggest border crossing with Iran. On the same day, Taliban insurgents captured the border town of Torghundi on the border with Turkmenistan as the Afghan National Security Forces collapsed in Herat. The Interior Ministry said that troops had been "temporarily relocated" and that efforts were underway to recapture the border crossing. In addition, a spokesperson for Kandahar Province Governor Rohullah Khanzada mentioned that the Taliban had captured the city of Kandahar. <2011 - Timeline>\\c\\cOn 22 July, 100 people were killed in a mass shooting in Spin Boldak District. <2011 - Timeline>\\c\\cOn 3 August, a suicide car bomber and gunmen attacked Kabul. Thirteen people — including five attackers — were killed. <2011 - Timeline>\\c\\cOn 9 August, #SanctionPakistan became one of the top Twitter trends in Afghanistan and worldwide, with Afghans holding Pakistan responsible for its support of the Taliban. [ADD] <2011 - Timeline>\\c\\cBy 12 August, about two-thirds of the country was in Taliban hands, with only four cities outside of Taliban control. [ADD] Sectors of the United States government estimated that Kabul would fall within 30 days, and American diplomats were reportedly requesting that the Taliban not deface the American embassy there. Today it produces 93% of the global crop, and the drug trade accounts for half of Afghanistan's GDP. <2011 - Timeline>\\c\\cOn 28 July 2009, Richard Holbrooke, the United States special envoy for Afghanistan and Pakistan, said that money transfers from Western Europe and the Gulf States exceeded the drug trade earnings and that a new task force had been formed to shut down this source of funds. <2011 - Timeline>\\c\\cThe United States Agency for International Development is investigating the possibility that kickbacks from its contracts are being funneled to the Taliban. <2011 - Timeline>\\c\\cA report by the London School of Economics (LSE) claimed to provide the most concrete evidence yet that the Pakistani intelligence agency ISI is providing funding, training and sanctuary to the Taliban on a scale much larger than previously thought. The report's author Matt Waldman spoke to nine Taliban field commanders in Afghanistan and concluded that Pakistan's relationship with the insurgents ran far deeper than previously realized. Some of those interviewed suggested that the organization even attended meetings of the Taliban's supreme council, the Quetta Shura. A spokesman for the Pakistani military dismissed the report, describing it as "malicious". <2011 - Timeline>\\c\\cnan
