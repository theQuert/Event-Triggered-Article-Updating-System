The COVID-19 pandemic in Queensland is part of the ongoing worldwide pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). <Summary>\\c\\cOn 29 January 2020, Queensland was the first to declare a public health emergency. The legislation was strengthened on 6 February by the Public Health (Declared Public Health Emergencies) Amendment Bill 2020. As of the end of July 2021, Queensland had recorded the death of just 7 patients with Covid-19. This fatality rate, of just under 1 per million residents, was the lowest not just in Australia, but of any sizeable jurisdiction with its own policing and health powers, in the world. <Timeline - 2020>\\c\\cKey directions made under the Public Health Act 2005 include: <Timeline - 2020>\\c\\c2 April – A person must not leave their principal place of residence except for essential needs including work, food, medical and exercise, outdoor gatherings only up to 2 persons or with members of household, receiving only to 2 visitors at a residence, and no gatherings in non-residences. <Timeline - 2020>\\c\\c9 April – "Non-essential" business, activity or undertaking must not be operated. "Non-essential" businesses include cinemas, casinos, concerts, indoor sports, gyms, playgrounds, campgrounds, libraries. Restrictions also apply to restaurants (take away or delivery only), churches, hairdressers etc. However, most construction, mining, manufacturing and retail businesses continued to operate. <Timeline - 2020>\\c\\cRestricted entry into Queensland was introduced, with only Queensland residents and those considered an \'exempt person\' being allowed to enter Queensland by air, sea, rail or road from another state or territory. This was introduced in stages: Stage 1 started on 26 March 2020, with stages 2 and 3 involving tightening the restrictions. Stage 4, introduced on 11 April, was the most restrictive, every person crossing the border including Queensland residents required a permit. In addition, a person who had been in a declared COVID-19 hotspot in the previous 14 days had to self-quarantine for 14 days. <Timeline - 2020>\\c\\cClosure of high visitation National Parks including Fraser Island as well as all day use areas and visitor centres on 9 April. <Timeline - 2020>\\c\\cClosure of Queensland waters to cruise ships on 6 April. <Timeline - 2020>\\c\\cClosure of Surfers Paradise, Coolangatta and The Spit beaches on 8 April. <Timeline - 2020>\\c\\cAccess to the Torres Strait Islands has been restricted to prevent COVID-19 from reaching the region, which has to date remained free of cases. <Timeline - 2020>\\c\\cOn 1 February 2021, Queensland opened its border to all Australian states and territories except Western Australia. Since the border closures were implemented, 6,855,750 border passes were issued. <Timeline - 2021>\\c\\cOn 22 February, the first Queenslander received a COVID-19 vaccination at Gold Coast University Hospital. She was a nurse who works in that hospital's COVID-19 ward. <Timeline - 2021>\\c\\cOn 28 February 2021, the "Check in Qld" QR code sign-in/contact tracing app was launched by the Minister for Health and Ambulance Services, Yvette D\'Ath. It is based on the ACT "Check in CBR" app. Use of the app is not mandatory. <Timeline - 2021>\\c\\cOn 12 March, Princess Alexandra Hospital in Brisbane went into lockdown after a doctor tested positive for COVID-19. This was the beginning of one cluster in Brisbane connected to that hospital. Queensland had gone 59 days without any locally acquired COVID-19 infections. <Timeline - 2021>\\c\\cDue to a growing cluster in Bondi, Sydney, from 1am on 24 June, the Queensland government declared all of Greater Sydney was a hotspot. Border entry will be refused to anyone who lives in, or has visited: Greater Sydney, the Blue Mountains, Central Coast, Wollongong or Shellharbour. Residents returning will be quarantined for 14 days. Everyone entering Queensland will have to complete a border declaration. <Timeline - 2021>\\c\\cOn 8 January 2021, a three-day lockdown was announced by Annastacia Palaszczuk to prevent spread of the more contagious UK strain of coronavirus that escaped from a Brisbane hotel quarantine. The lockdown applied to all of greater Brisbane including council areas of Brisbane, Ipswich, Logan City, Moreton Bay and Redland City from 6 pm that day. More than 2 million residents were affected. <Timeline - Brisbane lockdowns>\\c\\cOn 29 March at 5 pm, Greater Brisbane went into yet another three-day lockdown. The step was taken when a second cluster of the UK strain of COVID-19 grew to seven people. Two of them were an un-vaccinated nurse from Princess Alexandra Hospital, and her sister. By 30 March another 8 locally acquired cases were reported, for a total of 10 new cases in the preceding 24 hours, and 2 separate clusters, both UK strain were identified. As of this date Queensland had 78 active cases in hospitals. On 31 March in Queensland 34,711 coronavirus tests and 7,596 vaccinations were conducted. <Timeline - Brisbane lockdowns>\\c\\cOn 1 April, the "three-day" lockdown was lifted five hours early at midday. Though 10 new cases had been recorded in the previous 24 hours, there was only one case of community transmission, which was linked to the second cluster surrounding the infected nurse from the Princess Alexandra Hospital. This cluster now numbered 12, up from 7 on 29 March. <Timeline - Brisbane lockdowns>\\c\\cSome restrictions introduced for the lockdown were maintained temporarily: <Timeline - Brisbane lockdowns>\\c\\call Queenslanders had to carry a face-mask outside their home until 15 April, <Timeline - Brisbane lockdowns>\\c\\cpatrons at food or beverage venues had to stay seated, no dancing allowed, <Timeline - Brisbane lockdowns>\\c\\c30 person limit at private gatherings at homes statewide, <Timeline - Brisbane lockdowns>\\c\\cbusinesses and churches could open, but have only one-person-per 2-square-metres of floor area, <Timeline - Brisbane lockdowns>\\c\\cvisitors were not permitted for 2 weeks at: aged or disabled care facilities, hospitals and prisons. <Timeline - Brisbane lockdowns>\\c\\cOn 28 June Queensland recorded 3 new COVID-19 cases overnight. 2 were locally acquired, one acquired overseas. A miner was found to be infected with the Delta variant of COVID-19 after returning from the Northern Territory.

This move was taken after a casual clerical worker from Prince Charles Hospital in Brisbane, who worked outside the COVID ward as a concierge, became infected with the Delta variant and travelled from Sandgate in Brisbane to Magnetic Island and Townsville where she visited markets. From 6:00am on 23 July to 6:00am on 20 August the same rules will be used across the state, except for SE Queensland where masks were still required. <Timeline - Brisbane lockdowns>\\c\\cIn SE Queensland wearing a face mask is mandatory whenever outside the home, unless: <Timeline - Brisbane lockdowns>\\c\\cin a car alone <Timeline - Brisbane lockdowns>\\c\\cor with household members <Timeline - Brisbane lockdowns>\\c\\ceating or drinking <Timeline - Brisbane lockdowns>\\c\\cexercising <Timeline - Brisbane lockdowns>\\c\\coutdoors alone <Timeline - Brisbane lockdowns>\\c\\cor with household members <Timeline - Brisbane lockdowns>\\c\\cit is unsafe <Timeline - Brisbane lockdowns>\\c\\cOn 24 July 2021, there was an anti-lockdown protest in Brisbane.
